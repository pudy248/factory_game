Hello, I see you have come to serve our great and powerful Overlord. I am glad your love of machinery is so great you are willing to offer your services to it.

The game can be played with mouse and keyboard or exclusively with the keyboard.
Left clicking will place tiles, right clicking will remove tiles while using the mouse and tiles will follow the mouse in mouse mode (which is the default).
While in mouse mode, left clicking a tile in the hotbar will select it.
Pressing left shift will toggle keyboard only mode, where the selected tile no longer follows the mouse and instead is controlled by the W,A,S,D keys.
While in keyboard only mode you can place tiles with the space bar or enter key, and can remove them by pressing the right shift key.
While in either mode you can rotate tiles either by using the r key, which will rotate them 90Â°, or by selecting the direction for them to face with the arrow keys, and tiles can be selected by pressing a number key based on the hotbar.

To toggle the hotbar and crafting tree press the tab key.
